A game designed for touchscreen where players take roles on a ship. Created in just over a week as a game jam.

Each role on the ship allows for a different ability. The aim of the game is to "consult" with contracts floating in space, making them smaller until you are able to suck them onboard your ship.

The money gun can be fired at issues to keep them away!
